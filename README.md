COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a disease caused by a virus named SARS-CoV-2. It can be very contagious and spreads quickly. Over one million people have died from COVID-19 in the United States.

HOW IT SPREADS:-

COVID-19 spreads when an infected person breathes out droplets and very small particles that contain the virus. Other people can breathe in these droplets and particles, or these droplets and particles can land on their eyes, nose, or mouth. In some circumstances, these droplets may contaminate surfaces they touch. Anyone infected with COVID-19 can spread it, even if they do NOT have symptoms.

WHO IS AT RISK:-

Some people are more likely than others to get very sick if they get COVID-19. This includes people who are older, are immunocompromised (have a weakened immune system), have certain disabilities, or have underlying health conditions.

PREVENTION:-

There are many actions you can take to help protect you, your household, and your community from COVID-19. CDC recommends that you:

Stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccines
Practice good hygiene (practices that improve cleanliness)
Take steps for cleaner air
Stay home when sick
Seek health care promptly for testing and treatment when you are sick if you have risk factors for severe illness
Antibodies and Protection

Antibodies are proteins your immune system makes to help fight infection and protect you from getting sick in the future. A positive antibody test result can help identify someone who has had COVID-19 in the past or has been vaccinated against COVID-19. Studies show that people who have antibodies from an infection with the virus that causes COVID-19 can improve their level of protection by getting vaccinated.

TREATMENT AND PROTECTION:-

Treatment may help lower your risk of severe illness. Masks, physical distancing, and tests can provide additional layers of protection.
